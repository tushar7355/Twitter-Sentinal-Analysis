The objective of this project is to detect the sentiment in tweets. 
For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. 
So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.
A model is designed and trained that could predict positive or negative comments on twitter. Using Naive
Bayes classification algorithm the data is labeled as 0 for positive comments and 1 for negative comments.
Libraries used are NLTK and TextBlob. A supervised learning model is developed using Python and NLP libraries.
